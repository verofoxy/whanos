;
; To build the Befunge-93 reference executables using DICE C
; under AmigaDOS 1.3, you can either run
;
;   protect build.seq srwd
;   build.seq
;
; or you can simply type the following commands into the shell:
;
dcc src/bef.c -o bin/bef
dcc src/befprof.c -o bin/befprof
;dcc src/bef2c.c -o bin/bef2c    ; DICE C can't handle this one.
