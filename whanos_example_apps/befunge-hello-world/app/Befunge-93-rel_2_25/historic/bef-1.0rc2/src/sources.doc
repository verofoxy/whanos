hello.bf      Chris           The ubiquitous 'Hello, World!' program.

hwii.bf       Chris           Prints out "Hello, World!' forwards, then
                              backwards, then forwards, etc.  Demonstrates
                              how one can so easily change the direction of
                              the PC to support their own wicked desires.

fact.bf       Chris           Asks for a number, and supplies the
                              factorial of that number.

random.bf     Chris           Generates statistically evenly distributed
                              random numbers between 1 and 9.

chars.bf      Kalyna          Generates a printable ASCII table, with
                              characters and corresponding codes in
                              decimal.

drx.bf        Chris           Like Eliza.

robot.bf      Chris           You control an 'O' going through a maze
                              of '*''s.  You can type in 'n', 's', 'e',
                              or 'w', and the 'O' travels in that map
                              direction.  Bug : you must press return
                              immediately after your choice of direction.
                              The 'game' ends when you hit a '*'.

maze.bf       Chris           Back in the old days of Commode 64's, I'd
                              have plenty of fun with this program :
                              flip a coin, if heads, print a fore-slash,
                              if tails, print a back-slash.  You may or
                              may not have as much fun as I did with this
                              maze-like pattern generator.

primes.bf     Kalyna          Lists the counting numbers, going up from
                              one, and confirms if they are prime or
                              not.

anagram.bf    Kalyna          Produces anagrams of words you type in.

numer.bf      Chris           Produces numerological equivalents of words
                              you type in.

toupper.bf    Chris           Converts letters to upper-case.
